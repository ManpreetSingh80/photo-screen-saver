# Offer Assistance With Translations

I am Looking for people relatively fluent in English and another
language to help me translate the extension. It consists of a couple
hundred short phrases and one 50 line file. I can generate a machine
translation using Google's API to get you started.

As a thank you, I will donate $25 to [Direct Relief International](https://www.directrelief.org/international/)
for each language translation.  Even if you can't help, I'd appreciate
if you could share this with others who may be interested.

If you'd like to help, please [email](mailto:photoscreensaver%40gmail.com) me.

Here is the list of all [languages](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/i18n?csw=1#localeTable) supported by Chrome

I appreciate any of them (Dutch and French are complete), but my highest priorities are:
* Spanish
* Italian
* Japanese
* Russian
* German
* Korean
* Traditional Chinese
* Hebrew
* Hindi.

I would also take one for the Queen's English
(you know, add some 'ou' spellings and a 'brilliant' here and there, ha ha).

Here is the text that needs translation:

This is all the text in the extension
The text following each '"message":'  are what need to be translated.

The encoding is UTF-8.

I have already performed machine translations of several languages
[here](https://github.com/opus1269/photo-screen-saver/tree/master/store/machine_translate_locales)
and [here](https://github.com/opus1269/photo-screen-saver/tree/master/store/machine_translate_descriptions)
if you don't want to start from scratch.
